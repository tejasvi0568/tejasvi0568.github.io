            Cultural diversity refers to the variety of traditions, customs, languages, and beliefs that exist among people worldwide. It enriches societies by promoting understanding, creativity, and innovation. Embracing different cultures fosters mutual respect and helps build inclusive communities. In an increasingly globalized world, preserving cultural heritage while embracing new influences is essential for a harmonious society.
